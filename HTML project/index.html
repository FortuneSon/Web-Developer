            <p><em>"Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward? First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown in the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake."
                -- Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. from MythicalManMonth</em></p>

            <h3>About Programming</h3>
            While some people write programs to solve important problems, or just to get a paycheck, many programmers actually enjoy the activity. Many mere mortals can't understand why.
        <br>
                There are many things tha you can enjoy while promming, such as:
                <ul>

                    <li><em>Learn how things work</em></li>
                    <li><del>Solve Puzzles</del></li>
                    <li><sup>Creativity</sup></li>
                    <li><sub>Deep Concentration</sub></li>

                </ul>
